          <p>
            I am a Business Information Systems student at Saskatchewan Polytechnic in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan expecting to graduate in April 2026. 
            I am passionate about technology and problem solving. I enjoy building web applications and learning new technologies.
             I am planning on relocating to Calgary or Saskatoon to pursue a career in the IT field upon graduation and am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
          </p>

            In my free time I enjoy going to the gym, playing hockey, learning new skills and spending time with friends and family.
