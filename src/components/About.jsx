                <p>
                I am a Business Information Systems student at Saskatchewan Polytechnic in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan expecting to graduate in April 2026. 
                I am passionate about technology and problem solving. I enjoy building web applications and learning new technologies.
                I am planning on relocating to Calgary or Saskatoon to pursue a career in the IT field upon graduation and am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
