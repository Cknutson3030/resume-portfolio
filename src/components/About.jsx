          <p>
            I'm a Business Information Systems student at Saskatchewan Polytechnic with hands-on 
            experience designing and supporting application systems, data workflows, and cloud-based 
            solutions. I have a strong background in troubleshooting, technical documentation, and 
            collaborating across technical and non-technical teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interests lie in systems, analytics, and technical roles, with a growing focus on 
            cloud technologies—particularly AWS. I enjoy building scalable solutions and exploring 
            how technology can solve real-world problems efficiently.
